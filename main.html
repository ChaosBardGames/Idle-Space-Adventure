        <h1>Welcome to Idle Space Adventure By ChaosBardGames!</h1>
        <p>This game exists soley because the type of game I wanted to play doesn't exist.</p>

        <h2>The Deck of the Avon Space Station</h2>
        <p>You stand in an elevator on the Avon Space Station, on the edge of charted space. You're here to begin your own journey as an explorer of the unknown regions.</p>
        <p>You chose Avon as your starting point for several reasons. First and foremost, they have cheap spacecraft for sale; you don't own one yet, but you're going to buy one soon.</p>
        <p>Secondly, the tax rate is low, at least compared to the core regions. At only 25%, it's almost a third of the taxes on your homeworld.</p>
        <p>And of course, Avon is owned by the Zindarian Elite Forces, better known as ZEF. It's a very safe place to start out, as the ZEF regularly patrol the area. </p>
        <p>The elevator dings, and you step out onto the market deck. There's a whole selection of surplus ZEF ships that are for sale. You walk over, and the seller wastes no time trying to make a sale.</p>
